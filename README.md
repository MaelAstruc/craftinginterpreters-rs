# Crafting interpreters in Rust

This repo follows the Book "[Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com)" by Robert Nystrom to create an interpreter in Rust.

The only purpose of this repo is to share my journey to learn Rust and the inner workings of an interpreter.

It includes two directories:

- tree-walk: A tree-walk interpreter for Lox in Rust
- bytecode-vm: TODO
